# California-Fire-Weather-Index-Calculations-Python
This python code was used to complete a homework assignment in Geog 288CJ during the Spring 2022 quarter at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In this code we compute and produce related plots for various fire weather indices for two model (WRF) gridpoints in the state of California (USA).
